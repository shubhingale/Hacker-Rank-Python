Task
Given the participants’ score sheet for your University Sports Day, you must find the runner-up score. You are given n scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

Input Format
The first line contains n. The second line contains an array A[] of n integers are each separated by a space.

Constraints
2 ≤  n ≤  10

-100 ≤  A[i] ≤ 100

Output Format
Print the runner-up score.

Sample Input 0
5

2 3 6 6 5
Sample Output 0
5
 

Explanation 0
The given list is [2, 3, 6, 6, 5]. The maximum score is 6, the second maximum score is 5. Hence, we print 5 as the runner-up score.

 

Solution: 



Steps Used in solving the problem -
Step 1: First n will take an integer type input of n scores.

Step 2: then, arr will make a list of these n scores.

Step 3: After this, we converted our list to set so, it will not store multiple same integers.

Step 4: then, I sorted my list of scores.

Step 5: In the last step I printed the second-last integer of my list. And, it is the runner-up score.
